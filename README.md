# Team8983 - The repository for Legitimus Robotics (Team 8983) code team's code base.

## VISION STATEMENT
Legitimus Robotics, FTC team 8983, seeks to enrich the Canton Community by providing STEM workplace environments for young students throughout the town, developing bonds between mentors and students, as well as providing a medium for reaching out to our community.

## MISSION STATEMENT
Our mission at Legitimus Robotics is to develop studentsâ€™ skills in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, business and design. While learning, real-world skills students will develop leadership and communication skills that students will carry with them into college and apply in their professional lives. We accomplish this goal through teamwork, innovation, trust, communication, and many other ways regularly practiced in all fields of the team.

## Legitimus Robotics main goals are to:
- Expose members of the community to the opportunities available in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) in a supportive and diverse environment

- Help members understand what roles engineering plays in improving the world and the progression of the human race

- Inspire members to further education and pursue careers in STEM fields 

- Encourage members to pass on their knowledge fostered on this team to family, friends, and members of the community to help better their lives

- Provide a teamwork oriented environment for students to work collaboratively in

- Teach students how to overcome obstacles and think around problems to find a valuable solutions
## Code-Team
Code team's purpose is exactly in the name.  We work to write code for the robots that Build-Team builds.  Our team is essential to the whole operation since the robot would not be able to move or function without the code written by Code-Team.  Code-Team consists of 6 members, which include Matthew, Michael, Carson, Mackenzie, Elissa, and Cameron.  The current head of Code-Team is Matthew and drives the team to success by writing complex code and helping the other members understand what is going on and what need to happen.
